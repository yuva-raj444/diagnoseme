### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  User selects a medical photo.
2.  The frontend compresses the image:
    * Maximum dimension: 800px
    * JPEG quality around 80%
3.  The compressed image is converted to Base64.
4.  Base64 data is sent to a Next.js API route.
5.  The API calls Google Gemini with:
    * a custom medical analysis prompt
    * the compressed image
6.  Gemini responds with a diagnosis and treatment details.
7.  Frontend displays the result beautifully!
